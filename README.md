## Chromium for Serverless platforms

[sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda) was originally forked from [alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda#264](https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda/pull/264).
The biggest difference, besides the chromium version, is the inclusion of some code from https://github.com/alixaxel/lambdafs, as well as dropping that as a dependency. Due to some changes in WebGL, the files in bin/swiftshader.tar.br need to be extracted to `/tmp` instead of `/tmp/swiftshader`. This necessitated changes in lambdafs.

However, it quickly became difficult to maintain because of the pace of `puppeteer` updates. This package, `@sparticuz/chromium`, is not chained to `puppeteer` versions, but also does not include the overrides and hooks that the original package contained. It is only `chromium`, as well as the special code needed to decompress the brotli package, and a set of predefined arguments tailored to serverless usage.

## Install

[`puppeteer` ships with a preferred version of `chromium`](https://pptr.dev/faq/#q-why-doesnt-puppeteer-vxxx-work-with-chromium-vyyy). In order to figure out what version of `@sparticuz/chromium` you will need, please visit [Puppeteer's Chromium Support page](https://pptr.dev/chromium-support).

> For example, as of today, the latest version of `puppeteer` is `18.0.5`. The latest version of `chromium` stated on `puppeteer`'s support page is `106.0.5249.0`. So you need to install `@sparticuz/chromium@106`.

```shell
# Puppeteer or Playwright is a production dependency
npm install --save puppeteer-core@$PUPPETEER_VERSION
# @sparticuz/chromium can be a DEV dependency IF YOU ARE USING A LAYER, if you are not using a layer, use as a production dependency!
npm install --save-dev @sparticuz/chromium@$CHROMIUM_VERSION
```

If your vendor does not allow large deploys (`chromium.br` is 50+ MB), you'll need to host the `chromium-v#-pack.tar` separately and use the [`@sparticuz/chromium-min` package](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium#-min-package).

```shell
npm install --save @sparticuz/chromium-min@$CHROMIUM_VERSION
```

If you wish to install an older version of Chromium, take a look at [@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda#versioning) or [@alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda).

## Versioning

The @sparticuz/chromium version schema is as follows:
`MajorChromiumVersion.MinorChromiumIncrement.@Sparticuz/chromiumPatchLevel`

Because this package follows Chromium's releases, it does NOT follow semantic versioning. **Breaking changes can occur with the 'patch' level.** Please check the release notes for information on breaking changes.

## Usage

This package works with all the currently supported AWS Lambda Node.js runtimes out of the box.

```javascript
const test = require("node:test");
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer-core");
const chromium = require("@sparticuz/chromium");

// Optional: If you'd like to disable webgl, true is the default.
chromium.setGraphicsMode = false;

// Optional: Load any fonts you need. Open Sans is included by default in AWS Lambda instances
await chromium.font(
  "https://raw.githack.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/master/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf"
);

test("Check the page title of example.com", async (t) => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: chromium.args,
    defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
    executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(),
    headless: chromium.headless,
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  const pageTitle = await page.title();
  await browser.close();

  assert.strictEqual(pageTitle, "Example Domain");
});
```

### Usage with Playwright

```javascript
const test = require("node:test");
// Need to rename playwright's chromium object to something else
const { chromium: playwright } = require("playwright-core");
const chromium = require("@sparticuz/chromium");

test("Check the page title of example.com", async (t) => {
  const browser = await playwright.launch({
    args: chromium.args,
    executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(),
    headless: chromium.headless,
  });

  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  const pageTitle = await page.title();
  await browser.close();

  assert.strictEqual(pageTitle, "Example Domain");
});
```

You should allocate at least 512 MB of RAM to your instance, however 1600 MB (or more) is recommended.

### -min package

The -min package DOES NOT include the chromium brotli files. There are a few instances where this is useful. Primarily, this is useful when your host has file size limits.

To use the -min package please install the `@sparticuz/chromium-min` package.

When using the -min package, you need to specify the location of the brotli files.

In this example, /opt/chromium contains all the brotli files

```
/opt
  /chromium
    /aws.tar.br
    /chromium.br
    /swiftshader.tar.br
```

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: chromium.args,
  defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
  executablePath: await chromium.executablePath("/opt/chromium"),
  headless: chromium.headless,
});
```

In the following example, https://www.example.com/chromiumPack.tar contains all the brotli files. Generally, this would be a location on S3, or another very fast downloadable location, that is in close proximity to your function's execution location.

On the initial iteration, `@sparticuz/chromium` will download the pack tar file, untar the files to `/tmp/chromium-pack`, then will un-brotli the `chromium` binary to `/tmp/chromium`. The following iterations will see that `/tmp/chromium` exists and will use the already downloaded files.

The latest chromium-pack.tar file will be on the latest [release](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases).

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: chromium.args,
  defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
  executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(
    "https://www.example.com/chromiumPack.tar"
  ),
  headless: chromium.headless,
});
```

### Running Locally & Headless/Headful mode

This version of `chromium` is built using the `headless.gn` build variables, which does not even include a GUI. Also, this package does not include an ARM version yet, which means it will not work on any M Series Apple products. If you need to test your code using a headful or ARM version, please use your locally installed version of `chromium/chrome`, or you may use the `puppeteer` provided version. Users have reported installing `rosetta` on MacOS will also work.

```shell
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromium@latest --path /tmp/localChromium
```

For more information on installing a specific version of `chromium`, check out [@puppeteer/browsers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@puppeteer/browsers).

For example, you can set your code to use an ENV variable such as `IS_LOCAL`, then use if/else statements to direct puppeteer to the correct environment.

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: process.env.IS_LOCAL ? puppeteer.defaultArgs() : chromium.args,
  defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
  executablePath: process.env.IS_LOCAL
    ? "/tmp/localChromium/chromium/linux-1122391/chrome-linux/chrome"
    : await chromium.executablePath(),
  headless: process.env.IS_LOCAL ? false : chromium.headless,
});
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I use ARM or Graviton instances?

At this point, @sparticuz/chromium does not support ARM.

- https://github.com/Sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda/pull/11

### Can I use Google Chrome or Chrome for Testing, what is chrome-headless-shell?

`headless_shell` is a purpose built version of `chromium` specific for headless purposes. It does not include the GUI at all and only works via remote debugging connection. This is what this package is built on.

- https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md
- https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:headless/app/headless_shell.cc
- https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell

### Can I use the "new" Headless mode?

From what I can tell, `headless_shell` does not seem to include support for the "new" headless mode.

### It doesn't work with Webpack!?!

Try marking this package as an external.

- https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/

### I'm experiencing timeouts or failures closing Chromium

This is a common issue. Chromium sometimes opens up more pages than you ask for. You can try the following

```typescript
for (const page of await browser.pages()) {
  await page.close();
}
await browser.close();
```

You can also try the following if one of the calls is hanging for some reason.

```typescript
await Promise.race([browser.close(), browser.close(), browser.close()]);
```

Always `await browser.close()`, even if your script is returning an error.

### `BrowserContext` isn't working properly (Target.closed)

You may not be able to create a new context, you can try to use the default context as seen in this patch: https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/issues/298

### I need Accessible pdf files

This is due to the way @sparticuz/chromium is built. If you require accessible pdf's, you'll need to
recompile chromium yourself with the following patch. You can then use that binary with @sparticuz/chromium-min.

_Note_: This will increase the time required to generate a PDF.

```patch
diff --git a/_/ansible/plays/chromium.yml b/_/ansible/plays/chromium.yml
index b42c740..49111d7 100644

           enable_media_remoting = false
```

## Fonts

The Amazon Linux 2 AWS Lambda runtime is not provisioned with any font faces.

Because of this, this package ships with [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans), which supports the following scripts:

- Latin
- Greek
- Cyrillic

To provision additional fonts, simply call the `font()` method with an absolute path or URL:

```typescript
await chromium.font("/var/task/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf");
// or
await chromium.font(
  "https://raw.githack.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/master/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf"
);
```

> `Noto Color Emoji` (or similar) is needed if you want to [render emojis](https://getemoji.com/).

> For URLs, it's recommended that you use a CDN, like [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/) or [gitcdn.xyz](https://gitcdn.xyz/).

This method should be invoked _before_ launching Chromium.

---

Alternatively, it's also possible to provision fonts via AWS Lambda Layers.

Simply create a directory named `.fonts` or `fonts` and place any font faces you want there:

```
.fonts
├── NotoColorEmoji.ttf
└── Roboto.ttf
```

Afterwards, you just need to ZIP the directory and upload it as a AWS Lambda Layer:

```shell
zip -9 --filesync --move --recurse-paths fonts.zip fonts/
```

Font directories are specified inside of the `fonts.conf` file found inside of the `bin/fonts.tar.br` file. These are the default folders:

- `/var/task/.fonts`
- `/var/task/fonts`
- `/opt/fonts`
- `/tmp/fonts`

## Graphics

By default, this package uses `swiftshader`/`angle` to do CPU acceleration for WebGL. This is the only known way to enable WebGL on a serverless platform. You can disable WebGL by setting `chromium.setGraphiceMode = false;` _before_ launching Chromium. Disabling this will also skip the extract of the `bin/swiftshader.tar.br` file, which saves about a second of initial execution time. Disabling graphics is recommended if you know you are not using any WebGL.

## Compiling

To compile your own version of Chromium check the [Ansible playbook instructions](_/ansible).

## AWS Lambda Layer

[Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) is a convenient way to manage common dependencies between different Lambda Functions.

The following set of (Linux) commands will create a layer of this package:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sparticuz/chromium.git && \
cd chromium && \
make chromium.zip
```

The above will create a `chromium.zip` file, which can be uploaded to your Layers console. You can and should upload using the `aws cli`. (Replace the variables with your own values)

```shell
bucketName="chromiumUploadBucket" && \
versionNumber="107" && \
aws s3 cp chromium.zip "s3://${bucketName}/chromiumLayers/chromium${versionNumber}.zip" && \
aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name chromium --description "Chromium v${versionNumber}" --content "S3Bucket=${bucketName},S3Key=chromiumLayers/chromium${versionNumber}.zip" --compatible-runtimes nodejs --compatible-architectures x86_64
```

Alternatively, you can also download the layer artifact from one of our [releases](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases).

According to our benchmarks, it's 40% to 50% faster than using the off-the-shelf `puppeteer` bundle.

## Migration from `chrome-aws-lambda`

- Change the import or require to be `@sparticuz/chromium`
- Add the import or require for `puppeteer-core`
- Change the browser launch to use the native `puppeteer.launch()` function
- Change the `executablePath` to be a function.

```diff
-const chromium = require('@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda');
+const chromium = require("@sparticuz/chromium");
+const puppeteer = require("puppeteer-core");

exports.handler = async (event, context, callback) => {
  let result = null;
  let browser = null;

  try {
-    browser = await chromium.puppeteer.launch({
+    browser = await puppeteer.launch({
      args: chromium.args,
      defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
-      executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
+      executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(),
      headless: chromium.headless,
      ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
    });

    let page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto(event.url || 'https://example.com');

    result = await page.title();
  } catch (error) {
    return callback(error);
  } finally {
    if (browser !== null) {
      await browser.close();
    }
  }

  return callback(null, result);
};
```

## Compression

The Chromium binary is compressed using the Brotli algorithm.

This allows us to get the best compression ratio and faster decompression times.
