## Chromium for Serverless Platforms

[sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda) was originally forked from [alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda#264](https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda/pull/264).

The main difference, aside from the Chromium version, is the inclusion of some code from https://github.com/alixaxel/lambdafs, while removing it as a dependency. Due to changes in WebGL, the files in `bin/swiftshader.tar.br` must now be extracted to `/tmp` instead of `/tmp/swiftshader`. This required changes in lambdafs.

However, maintaining the package became difficult due to the rapid pace of `puppeteer` updates. `@sparticuz/chromium` is not tied to specific `puppeteer` versions and does not include the overrides and hooks found in the original package. It provides only Chromium, the code required to decompress the Brotli package, and a set of predefined arguments tailored for serverless environments.

## Install

[`puppeteer` ships with a preferred version of `chromium`](https://pptr.dev/faq#q-why-doesnt-puppeteer-vxxx-work-with-a-certain-version-of-chrome-or-firefox). To determine which version of `@sparticuz/chromium` you need, visit the [Puppeteer Chromium Support page](https://pptr.dev/chromium-support).

> For example, as of today, the latest version of `puppeteer` is `18.0.5`, and the latest supported version of Chromium is `106.0.5249.0`. Therefore, you should install `@sparticuz/chromium@106`.

```shell
# Puppeteer or Playwright is a production dependency
npm install --save puppeteer-core@$PUPPETEER_VERSION
# @sparticuz/chromium can be a DEV dependency IF YOU ARE USING A LAYER. If you are not using a layer, use it as a production dependency!
npm install --save-dev @sparticuz/chromium@$CHROMIUM_VERSION
```

If your vendor does not allow large deployments (since `chromium.br` is over 50 MB), you will need to host the `chromium-v#-pack.tar` separately and use the [`@sparticuz/chromium-min` package](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium#-min-package).

```shell
npm install --save @sparticuz/chromium-min@$CHROMIUM_VERSION
```

If you need to install an older version of Chromium, see [@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda#versioning) or [@alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda).

## Versioning

The @sparticuz/chromium version schema is as follows:
`MajorChromiumVersion.MinorChromiumIncrement.@Sparticuz/chromiumPatchLevel`

Because this package follows Chromium's release cycle, it does NOT follow semantic versioning. **Breaking changes may occur at the 'patch' level.** Please check the release notes for details on breaking changes.

## Usage

This package works with all currently supported AWS Lambda Node.js runtimes out of the box.

```javascript
const test = require("node:test");
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer-core");
const chromium = require("@sparticuz/chromium");

// Optional: If you'd like to disable webgl, true is the default.
chromium.setGraphicsMode = false;

// Optional: Load any fonts you need.
await chromium.font(
  "https://raw.githack.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/master/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf"
);

test("Check the page title of example.com", async (t) => {
  const viewport = {
    deviceScaleFactor: 1,
    hasTouch: false,
    height: 1080,
    isLandscape: true,
    isMobile: false,
    width: 1920,
  };
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: puppeteer.defaultArgs({ args: chromium.args, headless: "shell" }),
    defaultViewport: viewport,
    executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(),
    headless: "shell",
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  const pageTitle = await page.title();
  await browser.close();

  assert.strictEqual(pageTitle, "Example Domain");
});
```

### Usage with Playwright

```javascript
const test = require("node:test");
// Need to rename playwright's chromium object to something else
const { chromium: playwright } = require("playwright-core");
const chromium = require("@sparticuz/chromium");

test("Check the page title of example.com", async (t) => {
  const browser = await playwright.launch({
    args: chromium.args, // Playwright merges the args
    executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(),
    // headless: true, /* true is the default */
  });

  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  const pageTitle = await page.title();
  await browser.close();

  assert.strictEqual(pageTitle, "Example Domain");
});
```

You should allocate at least 512 MB of RAM to your instance; however, 1600 MB (or more) is recommended.

### -min Package

The -min package does NOT include the Chromium Brotli files. This is useful when your host has file size limits.

To use the -min package, install the `@sparticuz/chromium-min` package instead of `@sparticuz/chromium`

When using the -min package, you must specify the location of the Brotli files.

In this example, `/opt/chromium` contains all the Brotli files:

```
/opt
  /chromium
    /al2023.tar.br
    /chromium.br
    /fonts.tar.br
    /swiftshader.tar.br
```

```javascript
const viewport = {
  deviceScaleFactor: 1,
  hasTouch: false,
  height: 1080,
  isLandscape: true,
  isMobile: false,
  width: 1920,
};
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: puppeteer.defaultArgs({ args: chromium.args, headless: "shell" }),
  defaultViewport: viewport,
  executablePath: await chromium.executablePath("/opt/chromium"),
  headless: "shell",
});
```

In the following example, `https://www.example.com/chromiumPack.tar` contains all the Brotli files. Generally, this would be a location on S3 or another very fast downloadable location that is close to your function's execution environment.

On the first run, `@sparticuz/chromium` will download the pack tar file, untar the files to `/tmp/chromium-pack`, and then decompress the `chromium` binary to `/tmp/chromium`. Subsequent runs (during a warm start) will detect that `/tmp/chromium` exists and use the already downloaded files.

The latest `chromium-pack.arch.tar` file is available in the latest [release](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases).

```javascript
const viewport = {
  deviceScaleFactor: 1,
  hasTouch: false,
  height: 1080,
  isLandscape: true,
  isMobile: false,
  width: 1920,
};
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: puppeteer.defaultArgs({ args: chromium.args, headless: "shell" }),
  defaultViewport: viewport,
  executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(
    "https://www.example.com/chromiumPack.tar"
  ),
  headless: "shell",
});
```

### Running Locally & Headless/Headful Mode

This version of Chromium is built using the `headless.gn` build variables, which do not include a GUI. If you need to test your code using a headful instance, use your locally installed version of Chromium/Chrome, or the version provided by Puppeteer.

```shell
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromium@latest --path /tmp/localChromium
```

For more information on installing a specific version of `chromium`, check out [@puppeteer/browsers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@puppeteer/browsers).

For example, you can set your code to use an environment variable such as `IS_LOCAL`, then use if/else statements to direct Puppeteer to the correct environment.

```javascript
const viewport = {
  deviceScaleFactor: 1,
  hasTouch: false,
  height: 1080,
  isLandscape: true,
  isMobile: false,
  width: 1920,
};
const headlessType = process.env.IS_LOCAL ? false : "shell";
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: process.env.IS_LOCAL
    ? puppeteer.defaultArgs()
    : puppeteer.defaultArgs({ args: chromium.args, headless: headlessType }),
  defaultViewport: viewport,
  executablePath: process.env.IS_LOCAL
    ? "/tmp/localChromium/chromium/linux-1122391/chrome-linux/chrome"
    : await chromium.executablePath(),
  headless: headlessType,
});
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use ARM or Graviton instances?

YES! Starting at Chromium v135, @sparticuz/chromium includes an arm64 pack.

### Can I use Google Chrome or Chrome for Testing? What is chrome-headless-shell?

`headless_shell` is a purpose-built version of Chromium specifically for headless purposes. It does not include a GUI and only works via remote debugging connection. This is what this package is built on.

- https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md
- https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:headless/app/headless_shell.cc
- https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell

### Can I use the "new" Headless mode?

From what I can tell, `headless_shell` does not seem to include support for the "new" headless mode.

### It doesn't work with Webpack!?

Try marking this package as an external dependency.

- https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/

### I'm experiencing timeouts or failures closing Chromium

This is a common issue. Chromium sometimes opens more pages than you expect. You can try the following:

```typescript
for (const page of await browser.pages()) {
  await page.close();
}
await browser.close();
```

You can also try the following if one of the calls is hanging for some reason:

```typescript
await Promise.race([browser.close(), browser.close(), browser.close()]);
```

Always `await browser.close()`, even if your script is returning an error.

### `BrowserContext` isn't working properly (Target.closed)

You may not be able to create a new context. You can try to use the default context as seen in this patch: https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/issues/298

### Do I need to use @sparticuz/chromium?

This package is designed to be run on a vanilla Lambda instance. If you are using a Dockerfile to publish your code to Lambda, it may be better to install Chromium and its dependencies from the distribution's repositories.

### I need accessible PDF files

This is due to the way @sparticuz/chromium is built. If you require accessible PDFs, you'll need to
recompile Chromium yourself with the following patch. You can then use that binary with @sparticuz/chromium-min.

_Note_: This will increase the time required to generate a PDF.

```patch
diff --git a/_/ansible/plays/chromium.yml b/_/ansible/plays/chromium.yml
index b42c740..49111d7 100644

           enable_linux_installer = false
           enable_media_remoting = false
```

## Fonts

The AWS Lambda runtime is not provisioned with any font faces.

Because of this, this package ships with [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans), which supports the following scripts:

- Latin
- Greek
- Cyrillic

To provision additional fonts, call the `font()` method with an absolute path or URL:

```typescript
await chromium.font("/var/task/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf");
// or
await chromium.font(
  "https://raw.githack.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/master/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf"
);
```

> `Noto Color Emoji` (or similar) is needed if you want to [render emojis](https://getemoji.com/).

> For URLs, it's recommended that you use a CDN, such as [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/) or [gitcdn.xyz](https://gitcdn.xyz/).

This method should be invoked _before_ launching Chromium.

---

Alternatively, you can also provision fonts via AWS Lambda Layers.

Create a directory named `.fonts` or `fonts` and place any font faces you want there:

```
.fonts
├── NotoColorEmoji.ttf
└── Roboto.ttf
```

Afterwards, zip the directory and upload it as an AWS Lambda Layer:

```shell
zip -9 --filesync --move --recurse-paths fonts.zip fonts/
```

Font directories are specified inside the `fonts.conf` file found inside the `bin/fonts.tar.br` file. These are the default folders:

- `/var/task/.fonts`
- `/var/task/fonts`
- `/opt/fonts`
- `/tmp/fonts`

## Graphics

By default, this package uses `swiftshader`/`angle` to do CPU acceleration for WebGL. This is the only known way to enable WebGL on a serverless platform. You can disable WebGL by setting `chromium.setGraphicsMode = false;` _before_ launching Chromium. Chromium still requires extracting the `bin/swiftshader.tar.br` file in order to launch. Testing is needed to determine if there is any positive speed impact from disabling WebGL.

## Contributing

### Updating the binaries

> **Note:** For security reasons, we do not accept PRs that include updated binary files. Please submit the changes to build files only, and the maintainers will compile and update the binary files.

1. Run `npm run update` to update [inventory.ini](_/ansible/inventory.ini) with the latest stable version of Chromium.
2. Make any necessary changes to the [build-arch.yml](_/ansible/plays/build-arch.yml) file.
3. Make any necessary changes to [inventory.ini](_/ansible/inventory.ini).
4. Run the appropriate command from the [Makefile](_/ansible/Makefile). Use `make build` to compile both x64 and arm64 versions.
5. If compiling both architectures and [al2023.tar.br](bin/x64/al2023.tar.br) has been modified, update the arm64 version by running `make build-arm-libs`.
6. Verify that the `chromium-###.#.#.#.br` files are valid.
7. Rename them to `chromium.br`.
8. If necessary, update the Open Sans font using `npm run build:fonts`.
9. Run tests on the new version of Chromium. (`npm run test:source` and `npm run test:integration`). Integration tests requires AWS SAM cli and docker installed.

### Updating Typescript application code

1. Edit any of the source files in [source](source/).
2. Create or update tests in [tests](tests/).
3. Lint the package using `npm run lint`.
4. Build the package using `npm run build`.
5. Test the updates using `npm run test:source`.
6. Run a full integration test using `npm run test:integration`. This requires AWS SAM cli and docker installed.

## AWS Lambda Layer

[Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) are a convenient way to manage common dependencies between different Lambda Functions.

The following set of (Linux) commands will create a layer of this package:

```shell
archType="x64" && \
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sparticuz/chromium.git && \
cd chromium && \
make chromium.${archType}$.zip
```

The above will create a `chromium.x64.zip` file, which can be uploaded to your Layers console. If you are using `arm64`, replace the value accordingly. You can and should upload using the `aws cli`. (Replace the variables with your own values.)

```shell
bucketName="chromiumUploadBucket" && archType="x64" && versionNumber="v135.0.0" && \
aws s3 cp chromium.${archType}.zip "s3://${bucketName}/chromiumLayers/chromium-${versionNumber}-layer.${archType}.zip" && \
aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name chromium --description "Chromium v${versionNumber} for ${archType}" --content "S3Bucket=${bucketName},S3Key=chromiumLayers/chromium-${versionNumber}-layer.${archType}.zip" --compatible-runtimes "nodejs20.x" "nodejs22.x" --compatible-architectures $(if [ "$archType" = "x64" ]; then echo "x86_64"; else echo "$archType"; fi)
```

Alternatively, you can also download the layer artifact from one of our [releases](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases).

## Compression

The Chromium binary is compressed using the Brotli algorithm.

This provides the best compression ratio and faster decompression times.
